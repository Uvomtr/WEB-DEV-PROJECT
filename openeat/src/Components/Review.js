              <p>
                "Hapag is a must-try when in Manila. Make reservations and
                prepare for a feast. Expect 10+ servings of traditional Filipino
                dishes reimagined with a modern twist. I look forward to
                visiting again when we return."

              <p>
                They served freshly baked pizza and the dessert panna cota was
                just to die for. I highly recommend this restaurant to all those
                likes pizza or italian food."

                from the past 10 years. Chele is worth a visit to everyone
                celebrating an occasion, visitors of Manila must check this
                venture into the Philippines cuisine."
